# Slide 1 — UMAP Overview
The UMAP reveals clear separation of immune cell populations based on their transcriptional profiles.  
Distinct clusters correspond to major lymphoid, myeloid, and progenitor-like groups.

---

# Slide 2 — Identified Cell Types
From the clustering and annotations, the dataset contains:

- CD4⁺ T cells  
- CD8⁺ T cells  
- Monocytes (CD14⁺ / CD16⁺)  
- B cells  
- Other T-cell subsets  
- Platelets  
- HSPC-like progenitor cells

# Slide 3 — Biological Interpretation
The composition suggests an immune-enriched sample rather than bone marrow.  
High lymphocyte abundance, limited granulocytes, and minimal precursor diversity point toward a PBMC-like profile.  
Expanded monocytes and activated T-cell states indicate an ongoing immune response.

# Slide 4 — Key Insight
CD8⁺ T cells and monocytes are more abundant than expected in steady-state conditions.  
This pattern is consistent with **infection-driven immune activation**, highlighting how single-cell data can reveal subtle shifts in immune status.
